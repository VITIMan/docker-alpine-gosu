docker-alpine-gosu
==================

This is a fork mendsley/docker-alpine-gosu. The Architecture and version have
been parametrized.

A version for arm architecture has been created too. 

### Caveats

I got an error in shebang when I'm trying to use gosu 1.8, the Dockerfiles are
using version 1.7.
